# Hold To Command

A small quality-of-life mod that separates **petting** and **commanding** tamed creatures.

In vanilla Valheim, interacting with a commandable tameable will immediately issue a command instead of allowing you to pet it.

This mod changes that behavior to:

* **Tap** → Pet creature
* **Hold** → Command creature
* **Shift + Use** → Rename (unchanged vanilla behavior)

---

## Features

* Restores the ability to pet commandable creatures
* Adds intentional hold-to-command interaction
* Adjusted hover text to reflect new controls
* Fully localized command label
* Lightweight and fully standalone (no dependencies)

---

## Installation

1. Install **BepInEx** for Valheim
2. Place `HoldToCommand.dll` into:

```
Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/
```

3. Launch the game

---

## Compatibility

* Client-side only
* Safe to install or remove at any time
* No impact on servers without the mod

---

## Notes

This mod intentionally does one thing only:
Improve interaction clarity between petting and commanding.

No configuration, no extra systems — just better input ergonomics.
